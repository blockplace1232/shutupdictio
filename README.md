## What SHUT UP Dictio Actually Does:

SHUT UP Dictio removes all unnecessary clutter from these websites, including games, puzzles, quizzes, and anything else that could distract you. The website is meant to be used solely for dictionary and thesaurus purposes, and this code keeps only the essentials.

## What SHUT UP Dictio Doesn't Do:

  It doesn't remove the banner at the bottom with copyright information or cookies.
  It doesn't remove the option to easily switch between the dictionary and thesaurus sites.
  It doesn't remove the search bar or any dictionary or thesaurus content.

You can use this tool as much as you'd like, and you can always add elements back to the website by simply removing the line that deletes them.

Thanks for using SHUT UP Dictio! :3
