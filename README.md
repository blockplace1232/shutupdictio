## What SHUT UP Dictio actually does.

Shut up dictio removes any and all bloat from your browsing from these websites.
It removes all the games, puzzles, quizzes and anything else that could distract you. 
The website was made to only be used for dictionary/thesarus purposes and so this code removes it all and only leaves the bare minimum.

## What SHUT UP Dictio doesn't do

It doesn't remove the banner at the bottom with the copyright information or cookies. It does not remove the option to easily switch between the sites.

It does not remove the search bar and does not remove any dictionary or thesarus information. 


Please use this as much as you want, plus you can always add elements back into the website by just removing the line that deletes it.

Thanks for using this :3
